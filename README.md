## About

HW 3's objective was to: create 3 different web pages exemplifying all of the different layouts we learned 
in class today:
	a. Two-column layout, fixed “social media bar” on the left side of the page 
	with a link to Facebook and Twitter
	b. Three-column layout web page
	c. An image gallery using floats

AND

*Push your assignment to GitHub and submit the GitHub link instead of the files. 
Put a README.md file in to describe your assignment


## Notes

* If you open any HTML page, you can navigate to the other pages of the assignment
* Made a content wrapper div with ```margin: 0 auto;```
* Made columns using liquid % layout
* I used a Game of Thrones lorem ipsum generator
